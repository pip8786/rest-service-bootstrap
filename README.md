rest-service-bootstrap
======================

Tomcat, Hibernate, Jersey, Jackson and MySQL all working together in IntelliJ.

To run, open in IntelliJ, check the context.xml for the database connection info (schema is under db), and configure your tomcat. Then you should be good to go.

Head over to localhost:8080/rest/User to see the users in the DB.
